                Strata Noble was born from a simple observation: too many businesses were struggling with the same fundamental challenges, 
                yet the solutions available were either too expensive for most companies or too generic to be truly effective.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-xl leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Our founder, Steve, spent years working with both Fortune 500 companies and scrappy startups, witnessing firsthand 
                how strategic innovation could transform businesses of any size. But he also saw how traditional consulting firms often 
                left smaller companies behind, focusing only on enterprise clients who could afford their premium services.

              <p className="text-xl leading-relaxed">
                That&apos;s why we created Strata Noble to democratize strategic innovation. We believe that every business, regardless of size, 
                deserves access to world-class strategic thinking, data-driven insights, and proven methodologies that can drive real, 
                measurable growth. Our mission is to help businesses build sustainable prosperity through strategic innovation that&apos;s

                Steve Hubbard is a New York City native now based in Las Vegas who has spent more than two decades turning operational noise into clear, data-driven action. He has overseen teams of 300-plus in national logistics environments, reducing incident rates by 15% and raising customer-satisfaction scores by 20% through process redesign and analytics.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                As an independent consultant he helps founders and small teams translate raw numbers into repeatable systems, routinely unlocking 6-to-12% revenue gains. Steve founded Strata Noble to give under-resourced entrepreneurs the strategic discipline and measurement tools that large enterprises take for granted. His current focus is building practical frameworks that let clients see the story in their data and act on it with confidence.

              <p>
                Outside client work he is drafting his forthcoming book <em>I Would Love to Die&hellip; But I Can&apos;t Right Now</em>, which explores purpose and resilience in modern work.
