# Performance Analysis Report - Strata Noble Website

## Executive Summary
The site is experiencing performance issues due to several factors identified during analysis. This report outlines the key problems and provides actionable solutions.

## Key Performance Issues Identified

### 1. **Build Failures Due to Missing Environment Variables**
- **Issue**: Build failing due to missing `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` environment variable
- **Impact**: Prevents proper production builds and optimization
- **Priority**: HIGH

### 2. **Heavy Dependencies and Bundle Size**
- **Issue**: Large number of dependencies including:
  - Framer Motion (animation library)
  - Multiple AWS SDK clients
  - Sentry monitoring
  - Multiple UI libraries (@radix-ui, @heroicons, lucide-react)
- **Impact**: Increased bundle size and slower initial page loads
- **Priority**: HIGH

### 3. **Database Query Performance**
- **Issue**: Analytics API route performs 6 parallel database queries without proper indexing or caching
- **Impact**: Slow API responses, especially for analytics dashboard
- **Priority**: HIGH

### 4. **Client-Side Rendering Issues**
- **Issue**: Heavy use of 'use client' components, including HeroSection with complex animations
- **Impact**: Increased JavaScript bundle size and slower Time to Interactive (TTI)
- **Priority**: MEDIUM

### 5. **Missing Performance Optimizations**
- **Issue**: No caching strategies, no image optimization configuration, no service worker
- **Impact**: Slower subsequent page loads and poor offline experience
- **Priority**: MEDIUM

### 6. **ESLint Warnings**
- **Issue**: Multiple ESLint warnings including missing dependencies in useEffect hooks
- **Impact**: Potential runtime issues and memory leaks
- **Priority**: LOW

## Detailed Analysis

### Bundle Size Analysis
Based on package.json analysis:
- **Heavy Animation Library**: Framer Motion adds significant bundle weight
- **Multiple Icon Libraries**: Both @heroicons/react and lucide-react are used
- **AWS SDK**: Multiple AWS clients loaded even if not used on all pages
- **Monitoring Overhead**: Sentry adds runtime overhead

### Database Performance
The analytics overview route performs multiple queries:
```typescript
const [
  totalOrdersResult,
  revenueResult,
  contactSubmissionsResult,
  emailMetricsResult,
  recentOrdersResult,
  conversionFunnelResult
] = await Promise.all([...])
```
- No caching mechanism
- No database indexes mentioned
- Complex aggregations performed in JavaScript rather than database

### Client-Side Performance
- HeroSection component uses heavy animations with Framer Motion
- Multiple 'use client' components increase hydration time
- No lazy loading for non-critical components (except services section)

## Recommended Solutions

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)

1. **Fix Environment Variables**
   - Set up proper environment variable configuration
   - Use conditional imports for Stripe functionality

2. **Implement Database Caching**
   - Add Redis caching for analytics queries
   - Implement database indexes for frequently queried fields

3. **Bundle Optimization**
   - Implement dynamic imports for heavy libraries
   - Remove unused dependencies
   - Optimize Webpack configuration

### Medium-Term Improvements

1. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Implement Web Vitals tracking
   - Add performance budgets
   - Set up Lighthouse CI

2. **Caching Strategy**
   - Implement API response caching
   - Add service worker for static assets
   - Use Next.js ISR for static content

3. **Code Splitting**
   - Lazy load dashboard components
   - Split vendor bundles more efficiently
   - Implement route-based code splitting

### Long-Term Optimizations

1. **Database Optimization**
   - Move complex aggregations to database views
   - Implement proper indexing strategy
   - Consider read replicas for analytics

2. **CDN and Asset Optimization**
   - Implement proper image optimization
   - Use CDN for static assets
   - Optimize font loading

## Performance Metrics to Track

1. **Core Web Vitals**
   - Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) < 2.5s
   - First Input Delay (FID) < 100ms
   - Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) < 0.1

2. **Bundle Metrics**
   - Total bundle size < 250KB gzipped
   - First-party JavaScript < 150KB
   - Third-party JavaScript < 100KB

3. **API Performance**
   - Database query time < 100ms
   - API response time < 200ms
   - Cache hit ratio > 80%

## Next Steps

1. Implement immediate fixes for environment variables and build issues
2. Add performance monitoring and establish baseline metrics
3. Implement caching and bundle optimization
4. Monitor and iterate based on real-world performance data
