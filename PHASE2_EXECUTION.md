## 1. Immediate "Block-and-Tackle" Actions (48 hours)

| Action | Why it matters | Owner | ETA |
|--------|----------------|-------|-----|
| **Flip `CALENDLY_ENABLED` to `true` and redeploy** | Restores friction-free scheduling on Contact and Workshop pages | DevOps | Day 1 |
| **Pick email provider (SendGrid) and add API key to env variables** | Enables all contact/discovery notifications and lays groundwork for lead-nurture automations | DevOps | Day 1 |
| **Create `/api/sendMail.ts` using SendGrid SDK + schema validation** | Powers Contact & Discovery forms (HTML + text templates) | Dev | Day 2 |
| **Smoke-test Stripe checkout again after redeploy** | Confirms payment flow remains intact post-env change | QA | Day 2 |

**Dev Notes:**
- `CALENDLY_ENABLED` is in `src/app/contact/page.tsx` (set to `true`).
- Add `SENDGRID_API_KEY` to `.env.local` and production env.
- `/api/sendMail.ts` should use Zod for validation, support both HTML and text, and be reusable for all transactional emails.
- After redeploy, run a full Stripe checkout test (use test card).
