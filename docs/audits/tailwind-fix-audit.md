# Tailwind CSS Fix & Platform Audit Report

## Issue Resolution Summary

### Problem Identified
- CSS Warning: "Unknown at rule @tailwind" in `src/app/globals.css`
- VSCode CSS validator not recognizing Tailwind CSS directives

### Root Cause Analysis
The warning was caused by VSCode's built-in CSS validator not recognizing Tailwind CSS's custom `@tailwind` directives. While the Tailwind CSS was properly configured and working, the IDE was flagging these as unknown rules.

### Solutions Implemented

#### 1. VSCode Configuration
- **Created `.vscode/settings.json`** with proper Tailwind CSS support:
  - Disabled default CSS validation (`"css.validate": false`)
  - Enabled Tailwind CSS language support
  - Configured file associations for better IntelliSense
  - Added experimental class regex patterns for better autocomplete

#### 2. Extension Recommendations
- **Created `.vscode/extensions.json`** with recommended extensions:
  - `bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss` - Tailwind CSS IntelliSense
  - `esbenp.prettier-vscode` - Code formatting
  - `dbaeumer.vscode-eslint` - ESLint integration
  - Additional productivity extensions

#### 3. Development Environment Cleanup
- Killed all running Node.js processes to ensure clean restart
- Removed `.next` build cache to eliminate middleware manifest errors
- Restarted development server successfully
