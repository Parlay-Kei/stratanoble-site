# Strata Noble Platform Audit Summary

This document summarizes the key findings from a comprehensive audit of the Strata Noble web platform.

### ‚úÖ Strengths

*   **Modern Tech Stack:** The platform is built with a modern and robust stack, including React, Framer Motion, and Tailwind CSS with `cva`.
*   **Good Performance & Animation:** Animations are smooth and used effectively. The application correctly respects the `prefers-reduced-motion` setting.
*   **Strong Accessibility Foundation:** The site achieves a high Lighthouse accessibility score (96/100) and follows several best practices, such as proper external link handling.
*   **Well-Structured Code:** The component-based architecture is clean, and the use of utility functions for styling (`cva`, `tailwind-merge`) is excellent.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas for Improvement

#### üî¥ High Priority

1.  **Accessibility: Color Contrast:** Several key text elements fail WCAG AA color contrast requirements, making them difficult to read for users with low vision. The entire color palette needs review.
2.  **UX: Incomplete Journeys:** Multiple navigation links lead to "Coming Soon" placeholder pages, which creates a broken user experience.
3.  **Security & Functionality: Contact Form:** The contact form is not functional and lacks a secure submission process and user feedback.
4.  **Accessibility: Missing Labels:** Interactive controls like slider arrows lack accessible names (`aria-label`), making them unusable for screen reader users.

#### üü° Medium Priority

1.  **Testing Gaps:** The code coverage report for the `CaseStudiesSlider` shows that its core interactive logic is untested.
2.  **UX: Inconsistent UI:** The `CaseStudiesSlider` lacks pagination indicators, which are present on the testimonials slider, creating an inconsistent user experience.

### Next Steps

The highest priority should be to address the accessibility and UX issues that directly impact a user's ability to navigate and use the site. Following that, bolstering test coverage and refining UI consistency will further improve the platform's quality and reliability.
