# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Product Name

**Strata Noble Platform** – Scalable Consulting‑as‑a‑Service (CaaS) for Underserved Entrepreneurs & Small Teams

---

## 1. Purpose & Vision

### Purpose

Democratize high‑impact business consulting by giving overlooked founders and under‑optimized small businesses a subscription‑based toolkit—combining data analytics, guided playbooks, and on‑demand expert support—that turns passion into profit without enterprise‑level budgets.

### Vision

Become the trusted operating partner for every self‑funded entrepreneur who needs systems, strategy, and accountability, delivering AI‑powered insights and human expertise through a single friction‑free experience.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

* Founders juggle disparate tools (spreadsheets, CRMs, inboxes) and lack structured guidance to scale operations.
* Traditional consulting is expensive, time‑boxed, and inaccessible to early‑stage businesses.
* DIY resources (YouTube, courses, templates) offer knowledge but no integrated execution framework or accountability.
* Data lives in silos, making it hard for owners to track KPIs, diagnose bottlenecks, or make informed decisions.
