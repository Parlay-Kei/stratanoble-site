# Dev Log – Linting, Logging, and Code Quality Improvements (July 1, 2025)

## 🧹 Linting & Code Quality
- Removed all `console.log` and `console.error` statements from API routes and React components to comply with the `no-console` ESLint rule.
- Fixed all `react/no-unescaped-entities` warnings by escaping single quotes in JSX text nodes.
- Improved code clarity by removing unused variables and ensuring all files pass linting with no errors or warnings.

## 📋 ESLint Ignore Updates
- Added `.eslintrc.js`, `create-stripe-prices.js`, and `test-checkout.js` to `.eslintignore` to avoid TypeScript parser errors on non-project files.

## 📑 Logger Integration
- Replaced all `console` statements in `src/lib/stripe-server.ts` with the `pino` logger for production-safe, structured logging.
- Added `pino` as a project dependency for robust server-side logging.

# Dev Log – Recent Activity (June 30 - July 1, 2025)

## Summary

Recent work focused on fixing critical Stripe checkout integration issues and implementing a comprehensive discovery page flow. The following major changes were completed:

## 🔧 **Stripe Checkout Integration - FIXED**

### **Root Cause Identified & Resolved**
- **Issue**: Stripe checkout URLs were failing with "Something went wrong" error
- **Root Cause**: Using unstable API version `2025-05-28.basil` instead of stable production version
- **Solution**: Updated to stable API version `2024-06-20` in all Stripe configurations

### **Files Modified**:
- `src/lib/stripe-server.ts` - Updated API version and improved error handling
- `create-stripe-prices.js` - Updated API version for consistency
- `.env.local` - Added proper Price ID environment variables

### **Price Configuration Fixed**:
- **Before**: Using Product IDs incorrectly
- **After**: Created proper Stripe Price objects:
  - Lite Package: `price_1RfxaYP9nerJTgg1lCMzAfMQ` ($1,200)
  - Core Package: `price_1RfxaZP9nerJTgg1mII8hgoQ` ($2,500)
  - Premium Package: `price_1RfxaZP9nerJTgg19xYIa4F1` ($5,000)
  - Workshop: `price_1RfxaZP9nerJTgg1XdusuVt9` ($97)

## 🆕 **Discovery Page Implementation**

### **New Pages Created**:
- `src/app/discovery/page.tsx` - Professional discovery form with comprehensive data collection
- `src/app/checkout/page.tsx` - Enhanced checkout page with order summary and customer context

### **Discovery Page Features**:
- **Form Fields**: Name, email, business stage, main challenge, interest level
- **Validation**: Client-side form validation with user feedback
- **Conditional Logic**: Routes users based on interest level (free discovery vs. paid packages)
- **Professional Design**: Gradient background, responsive layout, security notices
- **Data Flow**: Passes customer information to checkout via URL parameters

### **Checkout Page Enhancements**:
- **Parameter Handling**: Receives and displays customer data from discovery form
- **Order Summary**: Shows customer info, selected package, and pricing
- **Challenge Context**: Displays user's specific business challenge
- **Package Details**: Clear description of what's included
- **Loading States**: Professional UX with loading indicators
- **Stripe Integration**: Seamless payment processing with proper error handling

### **Service Card Integration Updated**:
- `src/app/services/ServiceCard.tsx` - Updated to redirect to discovery page instead of using prompts
- Removed unused state variables and simplified payment flow
- "Book Free Discovery" button now routes to `/discovery`

## 🔄 **Complete User Journey Implemented**

1. **Services Page** (`/services`) → User clicks "Book Free Discovery"
2. **Discovery Page** (`/discovery`) → User fills comprehensive form
3. **Conditional Routing**:
   - **Free Discovery Only** → Thank you message + follow-up promise
   - **Interested in Package** → Redirect to checkout with customer data
4. **Checkout Page** (`/checkout`) → Order summary + Stripe payment processing
5. **Stripe Checkout** → Secure payment with working URLs
6. **Success Page** (`/success`) → Confirmation and next steps
