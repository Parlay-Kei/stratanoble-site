# Dev Log – Today's Activity ({{ today's date }})

## Summary

Today's work focused on ensuring that the app builds and runs without import errors, and that the routing (using react-router-dom) works as expected. In summary, the following changes were made:

- **Installed react-router-dom:**  
  The missing dependency (react-router-dom) was installed so that the Header (and other components) can import and use routing functions (e.g. Link, Route, Routes, useLocation, useNavigate, Navigate) without errors.

- **Created placeholder pages and tab components:**  
  Several missing files (which were referenced in the routing and tab navigation) were created as placeholders so that the app can build without "Failed to resolve import" errors. In particular, the following files were created (or updated) as "Coming Soon" placeholders:
  – (Pages)  
    – (src/pages/AboutPage.tsx)  
    – (src/pages/CaseStudiesPage.tsx)  
    – (src/pages/TraditionalServicesPage.tsx)  
  – (Tab Components)  
    – (src/components/ai-services/AcceleratorTab.tsx)  
    – (src/components/ai-services/SupportTab.tsx)  
  (Note: Other tab components (e.g. AIMonetizationTab, AIAutomationTab, AIContentTab, AILiteracyTab) had already been created and are functional.)

- **Restarted the development server:**  
  After killing the process on port 8080 (using "npx kill-port 8080"), the dev server was restarted (via "npm run dev") so that the app runs on port 8080 (available at http://localhost: 8080/).

## Next Steps

– Further build out (or replace) the placeholder pages and tab components (e.g. About, Case Studies, Traditional Services, Accelerator, Support) as needed.– Continue testing and refining the routing (and overall UX flow) of the app.
