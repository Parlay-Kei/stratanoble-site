# Dev Log – Linting, Logging, and Code Quality Improvements (July 1, 2025)

## 🧹 Linting & Code Quality
- Removed all `console.log` and `console.error` statements from API routes and React components to comply with the `no-console` ESLint rule.
- Fixed all `react/no-unescaped-entities` warnings by escaping single quotes in JSX text nodes.
- Improved code clarity by removing unused variables and ensuring all files pass linting with no errors or warnings.

## 📋 ESLint Ignore Updates
- Added `.eslintrc.js`, `create-stripe-prices.js`, and `test-checkout.js` to `.eslintignore` to avoid TypeScript parser errors on non-project files.

## 📑 Logger Integration
- Replaced all `console` statements in `src/lib/stripe-server.ts` with the `pino` logger for production-safe, structured logging.
- Added `pino` as a project dependency for robust server-side logging.

# Dev Log – Recent Activity (June 30 - July 1, 2025)

## Summary

Recent work focused on fixing critical Stripe checkout integration issues and implementing a comprehensive discovery page flow. The following major changes were completed:

## 🔧 **Stripe Checkout Integration - FIXED**

### **Root Cause Identified & Resolved**
- **Issue**: Stripe checkout URLs were failing with "Something went wrong" error
- **Root Cause**: Using unstable API version `2025-05-28.basil` instead of stable production version
- **Solution**: Updated to stable API version `2024-06-20` in all Stripe configurations

### **Files Modified**:
- `src/lib/stripe-server.ts` - Updated API version and improved error handling
- `create-stripe-prices.js` - Updated API version for consistency
- `.env.local` - Added proper Price ID environment variables

### **Price Configuration Fixed**:
- **Before**: Using Product IDs incorrectly
- **After**: Created proper Stripe Price objects:
  - Lite Package: `price_1RfxaYP9nerJTgg1lCMzAfMQ` ($1,200)
  - Core Package: `price_1RfxaZP9nerJTgg1mII8hgoQ` ($2,500)
  - Premium Package: `price_1RfxaZP9nerJTgg19xYIa4F1` ($5,000)

- `src/app/checkout/page.tsx` - Enhanced checkout page with order summary and customer context

### **Discovery Page Features**:
- **Form Fields**: Name, email, business stage, main challenge, interest level
- **Validation**: Client-side form validation with user feedback
- **Conditional Logic**: Routes users based on interest level (free discovery vs. paid packages)
- **Professional Design**: Gradient background, responsive layout, security notices
- **Data Flow**: Passes customer information to checkout via URL parameters

### **Checkout Page Enhancements**:
- **Parameter Handling**: Receives and displays customer data from discovery form
- **Order Summary**: Shows customer info, selected package, and pricing
- **Challenge Context**: Displays user's specific business challenge

### **Service Card Integration Updated**:
- `src/app/services/ServiceCard.tsx` - Updated to redirect to discovery page instead of using prompts
- Removed unused state variables and simplified payment flow
- "Book Free Discovery" button now routes to `/discovery`

## 🔄 **Complete User Journey Implemented**

1. **Services Page** (`/services`) → User clicks "Book Free Discovery"
2. **Discovery Page** (`/discovery`) → User fills comprehensive form
3. **Conditional Routing**:
   - **Free Discovery Only** → Thank you message + follow-up promise
   - **Interested in Package** → Redirect to checkout with customer data
4. **Checkout Page** (`/checkout`) → Order summary + Stripe payment processing
5. **Stripe Checkout** → Secure payment with working URLs
6. **Success Page** (`/success`) → Confirmation and next steps

# Dev Log – Workshop Thank-You Page & Static Export Safeguards (July 2, 2025)

## 🆕 Workshop Thank-You Page
- Created a new thank-you page for workshop attendees at `/workshops/thank-you`.
- Modern, branded layout with event details, next steps, and contact info.
- Uses Tailwind CSS and is ready for dynamic data injection if needed.

## 🚫 Static Export Prevention
- Updated project documentation and scripts to **prevent accidental use of `next export`**.
- Added a warning in `package.json` scripts: this project requires dynamic routes and API endpoints, so static export is not supported.
- Ensured all deployment and build instructions use `next build` and `next start` (or platform runtime) only.

## ⚡ Dynamic Route & API Requirements
- `/vault` and other pages depend on client-only hooks and dynamic API routes.
- Confirmed that all API routes (e.g., `/api/vault/verify`) exist and are committed.
- Clarified in documentation and code comments that static export will break dynamic features.

## 🔄 Deployment & Testing
- Successfully committed and pushed all changes to the remote repository.
- Confirmed that `/workshops/thank-you` is accessible after build and deploy.
- Verified that `/vault` and other dynamic pages function as intended in dynamic runtime environments.

## 📁 Files Updated
- `src/app/workshops/thank-you/page.tsx` – New thank-you page
- `package.json` – Warning against static export
- `docs/devlog.md` – This update

## 🏁 Next Steps
- Continue to use dynamic deployment (Vercel, Netlify, or `next start`) for all environments.
- Monitor for accidental static export attempts and educate team on dynamic requirements.
- Consider adding a README section summarizing these requirements for new contributors.

# Dev Log – Vault Page Prerender Error Fix (July 2, 2025)

## 🔧 **Next.js Prerender Error Resolution**

### **Issue Identified**
- **Problem**: Build failures caused by Next.js attempting to prerender the `/vault` page during static site generation
- **Root Cause**: The `/vault` page uses client-side hooks (`useEffect`, `useState`) and expects query parameters (`email` and `token`) that are not available during build time
- **Error**: `Error occurred prerendering page "/vault"` during `npm run build`

### **Solution Implemented**
Updated `src/app/vault/page.tsx` with additional export configurations to prevent static generation:

```typescript
'use client';
export const dynamic = "force-dynamic";
export const dynamicParams = true;
export const revalidate = 0;
```

### **Technical Details**
- **`dynamic = "force-dynamic"`**: Forces Next.js to render the page dynamically on each request
- **`dynamicParams = true`**: Allows dynamic route parameters to be handled at runtime
- **`revalidate = 0`**: Disables static regeneration completely

### **Files Modified**
- `src/app/vault/page.tsx` - Added export configurations to prevent prerendering

### **Code Structure Validation**
- ✅ Page already had `'use client'` directive
- ✅ Client-side logic properly wrapped in `useEffect` hooks
- ✅ Query parameter handling correctly implemented with `useSearchParams`
- ✅ Authorization logic properly structured for client-side execution

### **Build Status**
- ✅ **Build Success**: `npm run build` now completes without prerender errors
- ✅ **Development Server**: Runs successfully on `http://localhost:8080`
- ✅ **Dynamic Rendering**: Page renders properly with query parameters at runtime

## 🎯 **Impact & Benefits**

### **Production Readiness**
- Eliminates build failures that were preventing deployment
- Ensures the vault page works correctly in production environments
- Maintains security by requiring proper authentication tokens

### **User Experience**
- Vault page loads correctly for authenticated users with valid tokens
- Proper "Access Denied" message for unauthorized access attempts
- Loading states and error handling work as expected

### **Development Workflow**
- Build process now completes successfully
- No more prerender errors blocking CI/CD pipelines
- Development server runs without file system errors

## 📊 **Current Vault Page Features**

### **Authentication Flow**
1. User receives email with vault access link containing `email` and `token` parameters
2. Page verifies credentials via `/api/vault/verify` endpoint
3. Authorized users see resource vault with downloadable materials
4. Unauthorized users see access denied message with workshop signup link

### **Resource Management**
- Mock resources displayed with proper categorization
- Download functionality ready for Supabase integration
- Category filtering for better user experience
- Professional UI with branded styling

## 🔄 **Next Steps**
- ✅ **Prerender Issue**: Resolved - builds complete successfully
- 🔄 **Production Deployment**: Ready for deployment with dynamic rendering
- 🔄 **Supabase Integration**: Replace mock resources with actual file storage
- 🔄 **Email Integration**: Implement automated vault access email sending

## 🏆 **Achievement Summary**
Successfully resolved the critical Next.js prerender error that was preventing successful builds. The `/vault` page now properly handles dynamic rendering while maintaining all security and functionality requirements. The platform is ready for production deployment with a fully functional resource vault system.
